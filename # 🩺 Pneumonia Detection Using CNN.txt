# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV** to detect **Pneumonia** from **chest X-ray images**.  
It automatically learns patterns from labeled X-rays to classify them as either **Normal** or **Pneumonia-infected** lungs.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of X-ray images using OpenCV  
- Deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras  
- Binary classification (Pneumonia / Normal)  
- Saves trained model in `.h5` format for future predictions  
- Includes error handling for missing or unreadable images

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- **Conv2D + ReLU** layers for feature extraction  
- **MaxPooling2D** layers for dimensionality reduction  
- **Flatten + Dense** layers for classification  
- **Sigmoid activation** for binary output
